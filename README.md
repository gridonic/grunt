# Grunt

Our tool of trade for build chains is [Grunt]. It might not be as fancy as [Gulp] or [Webpack], but it gets the job done. In order to make it also go out of our way, we use a super-simple [`Gruntfile.js`] and the [load-grunt-config] plugin to break our Gruntfile config up by task. To make the task loading fast, we spice it up with [jit-grunt].
